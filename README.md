# Bike Sharing

## Overview

The purpose of the analysis is to understand the use for citi bikes in New York. Through this analysis, we are hoping to understand who the users are, what time of day the use peaks, where the users are going, and the duration of the trips.

## Results:
In order to understand the scope of citi bikes, we need to first understand how widely these bikes are used for the month of August. And, after a brief count, we can see that there were over 2 million rides during the month.

Given the number of rides taken in August, it is important to understand the duration of these rides, since we will want to incentive those riders to use the services more in the future.

### Ride Duration
Accoring to this visual, of the 2 million rides, a majority of the rides were a minute long with the peak use time being 6-8 seconds. This tells us, that the vast majority of users are deciding to use bikes over other sources of transportation. Given that New York is extremely dense and motorized transporation can delay trips much longer than non-motorized trips, we can assume that shorts trips would be more efficient with a bike. The bikes would provide transportation from point A to point B where walking would not be the more efficient mode of transporation.

### Type of User
Since we do have so many users of these bikes, it would be important to understant what type of users we have. For this dataset, we have two type of users those who are subscribed to citi bikes and those who are just customers using the bikes as a one time or short term service. For this analysis we can assume that the customers will either be visitors or tourists.

According to this analysis, we can see that a majority of users are subscribed users.

Given that they are subscribed users, a majority of them are male.

This distrubtion of use can also be seen in the duration of use when we split the charts by gender as seen here.

From these charts, we can see that a majority of the riders are subscribed users, who most likely will be male and use the bike for a minute or less a majority of the time.

### Destinations
According to the recorded end destinations, we can gather that a majority of the riders are heading to a small clustered location, whether it be a central location in New York or a business hub.

And, similar to our previous user type analysis, we can see that a majority of the users are males who are going to these clustered end points.

## Summary:

According to this analysis, we understand that the target user for citi bikes will be subscribed males, who heavily use the bikes during peak commuting hours during the week. One way to expand the type of users and number of users, would be to look at how the other demographics interact with citi bike and what incentives them to use a bike over other non-motorized transportation methods.
